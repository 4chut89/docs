This page provides instructions for installing Dapr runtime v0.11. To install v1.0-rc2 preview, the release candidate for the upcoming v1.0 release please visit the [v1.0-rc2 docs version of this page](https://v1-rc1.docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr-selfhost/). Note you will need to ensure you are also using the preview version of the CLI (instructions to install the latest preview CLI can be found [here](https://v1-rc2.docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr-cli/)).

Now that you have the Dapr CLI installed, it's time to initialize Dapr on your local machine using the CLI. 

Dapr runs as a sidecar alongside your application, and in self-hosted mode this means as a process on your local machine. Therefore, initializing Dapr includes fetching the Dapr sidecar binaries and installing them locally.

In addition, the default initialization process also creates a development environment that helps streamlining application development with Dapr. This includes the following steps:

{{% alert title="Docker" color="primary" %}}
This recommended development environment requires [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/). It is possible to initialize Dapr without a dependency on Docker (see [this guidance]({{<ref self-hosted-no-docker.md>}})) but next steps in this guide assume the recommended development environment.
{{% /alert %}}

1. Running a Redis container instance to be used as a local state store and message broker
1. Running a Zipkin container instance for observability
1. Creating a default components folder with component definitions for the above
1. Running a container with a Dapr placement service for local actors

### Ensure you are in an elevated terminal

   {{< tabs "Linux/MacOS" "Windows">}}

   {{% codetab %}}
   If you run your docker commands with sudo or the install path is `/usr/local/bin`(default install path), you need to use `sudo`
   {{% /codetab %}}

   Make sure that you run the command prompt terminal in administrator mode (right click, run as administrator)

### Run the init CLI command

Install the latest Dapr runtime binaries:

```bash
dapr init
```

Instead of the latest Dapr binaries, you can install or upgrade to a specific version of the Dapr runtime using `dapr init --runtime-version`. You can find the list of versions in [Dapr Release](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/releases)


### Verify Dapr version

```bash
dapr --version
```

Output should look like this:
```
CLI version: 0.11
Runtime version: 0.11
```

### Verify containers are running

As mentioned above, the `dapr init` command launches several containers that will help you get started with Dapr. Verify this by running:

```bash
   docker ps
```

Make sure that instances with `daprio/dapr`, `openzipkin/zipkin`, and `redis` images are all running:

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                    COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                              NAMES
0dda6684dc2e   openzipkin/zipkin        "/busybox/sh run.sh"     2 minutes ago   Up 2 minutes   9410/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9411->9411/tcp   dapr_zipkin
9bf6ef339f50   redis                    "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   2 minutes ago   Up 2 minutes   0.0.0.0:6379->6379/tcp             dapr_redis
8d993e514150   daprio/dapr              "./placement"            2 minutes ago   Up 2 minutes   0.0.0.0:6050->50005/tcp            dapr_placement
```

### Verify components directory has been initialized

On init, the CLI also creates a default components folder which includes several YAML files with definitions for a state store, pub/sub and zipkin. These will be read by the Dapr sidecar, telling it to use the Redis container for state management and messaging and the Zipkin container for collecting traces.

- In Linux/MacOS Dapr is initialized with default components and files in `$HOME/.dapr`.
- For Windows Dapr is initialized to `%USERPROFILE%\.dapr\`


{{< tabs "Linux/MacOS" "Windows">}}

{{% codetab %}}
Run:
```bash
ls $HOME/.dapr
```
Output should look like so:

```
bin  components  config.yaml
```
{{% /codetab %}}

{{% codetab %}}
Open `%USERPROFILE%\.dapr\` in file explorer
