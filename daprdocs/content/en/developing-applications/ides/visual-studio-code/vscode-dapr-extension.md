## Features

### Scaffold Dapr tasks 

* Helps scaffold VS Code task.json and launch.json configurations needed to debug your application within the Dapr environment.
* Requires an already existing launch.json files to be found in the VS Code workspace.
* Example NodeJS app:


Before scaffolding version of launch.json configurations:
```json
{
     "version": "0.2.0",
     "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "pwa-node",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Launch Program",
            "skipFiles": [
                "<node_internals>/**"
            ],
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/app.js"
        }
}
```
After scaffolding version of launch.json:
```json
{
     "version": "0.2.0",
     "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "pwa-node",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Launch Program",
            "skipFiles": [
                "<node_internals>/**"
            ],
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/app.js"
        },
        {
            "type": "pwa-node",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Launch Program with Dapr",
            "skipFiles": [
                "<node_internals>/**"
            ],
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/app.js",
            "preLaunchTask": "daprd-debug",
            "postDebugTask": "daprd-down"
        }
}
```
After scaffolding task.json:

```json
{
	"version": "2.0.0",
	"tasks": [
		{
			"appId": "nodeapp",
			"appPort": 3500,
			"label": "daprd-debug",
			"type": "daprd"
		},
		{
			"appId": "nodeapp",
			"label": "daprd-down",
			"type": "daprd-down"
		}
	]
}
```

### Scaffold Dapr components 
* Generates the Dapr component assets needed for general Dapr applications.
* Provides a Component folder in your VS Code workspace that contains pubsub, statestore and a zipkin yaml file.
* Example pubsub file:

```yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: pubsub
spec:
  type: pubsub.redis
  metadata:
  - name: redisHost
    value: localhost:6379
  - name: redisPassword
    value: ""
```

### View running Dapr applications
* The Applications view shows Dapr applications running locally on your machine.

* Allows users to specify an optional payload for POST methods
