## Features

### Scaffold Dapr debugging tasks

The Dapr extension helps you debug your applications with Dapr using Visual Studio Code's [built-in debugging capability](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/debugging).

Using the `Dapr: Scaffold Dapr Tasks` [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) operation, you can update your existing `task.json` and `launch.json` files to launch and configure the Dapr sidecar when you begin debugging.

1. Make sure you have a launch configuration set for your app. ([Learn more](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/debugging))
1. Open the Command Palette with `Ctrl+Shift+P`
1. Select `Dapr: Scaffold Dapr Tasks`
1. Run your app and the Dapr sidecar with `F5` or via the Run view.

### Scaffold Dapr components

When adding Dapr to your application, you may want to have a dedicated components directory, separate from the default components initialized as part of `dapr init`.

To create a dedicated components folder with the default `statestore`, `pubsub`, and `zipkin` components, use the `Dapr: Scaffold Dapr Components` [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) operation.

1. Open your application directory in Visual Studio Code
1. Open the Command Palette with `Ctrl+Shift+P`
1. Select `Dapr: Scaffold Dapr Components`
1. Run your application with `dapr run --components-path ./components -- ...`
