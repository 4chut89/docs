[Azure Container Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/overview) is a serverless application centric hosting service where users do not see or manage any underlying VMs, orchestrators, or other cloud infrastructure. Azure Container Apps enables executing application code packaged in any container and is unopinionated about runtime or programming model.

Dapr is built-in as a first-class experience in Container Apps, letting you use Dapr building blocks without any manual deployment or management of Kubernetes or the Dapr runtime. Simply deploy your services and Dapr components and let the platform take care of the rest.
